# Diabetes Prediction Web App

This project is a web application built with Streamlit that predicts diabetes based on input data provided by the user. It utilizes a machine learning model (Random Forest Classifier) trained on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database.

# Features

- Allows users to input their health data (such as pregnancies, glucose level, blood pressure, etc.).
- Predicts the likelihood of diabetes based on the input data using a pre-trained machine learning model.
- Visualizes the patient's data against the dataset using scatter plots for comparison.
